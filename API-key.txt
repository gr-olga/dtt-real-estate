Feedback

Overall it is a good try, but the app seems a bit untested. In addition, it does not entirely follow the workflow. The app is not responsive at all, which is a requirement.

UI

When I refresh the house detail page, nothing is displayed. The same happens in the edit house page.

Create house - When selecting an image, the image is not properly previewed. (see here)

Edit house - When editing a house, the image is not set in the preview. (see here)

The delete modal should be located in the detail page. Make sure to follow a given workflow.

Houses list: The photo is the same for all the houses.

Structure

The store is not entirely utilised. We usually use the actions to make make API calls and receive data, which is committed to the store.

Logic

Create/edit house: The API has a min value for the construction year, so the house is not really created sometimes.

Create/edit: The address is not properly parsed into the input fields (e.g. street number and addition).

Create house: After creating a house, I am redirected to a blank page.

Edit house: I am not able to save the house, whose details I didn't even change. (see here).

Create/edit form: The validation is not sufficient, e.g. street number can be letters.
